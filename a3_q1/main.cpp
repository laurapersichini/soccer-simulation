 SYDE 121 Assignment #3
 File Name: a3_q1.cpp
 
 I hereby declare that this code, submitted for credit for the course
 SYDE121, is a product of my own efforts. This coded solution has
 not been plagiarized from other sources and has not been knowingly
 plagiarized by others.

 Project: Soccer game simulation
 Purpose: Write a program that simulates a game of soccer where two teams are playing a single game (team A vs team B)
 Due date: November 1, 2020
 Warning: I used a time delay between the events to enhance the experience. This will explain the delay between events.
 */

/*
 To test the program, I ran it multiple times to assess both the randomness of the numbers being generated,
 and that the logic behind the code was correct. I used a pencil and paper to tally statistics for the teams
 to ensure that the values being ouputted were accurate and that the logic I used to create the program
 was valid. As I was creating the program, I tested the blocks of code as they were being written to avoid
 not being able to identify errors once more code was written. For example, the number generator was outputting
 the same value. I tested this and realized the error was being caused by the number generator using time
 as the seed. Altering the seed to null fixed this problem. Also, I ran my program until I had seen that all of the
 possible events had occured. One limitation of this program could be that it is not an exact simulation of soccer
 in real life. For example, in real-life soccer, the teams are often not evenly matched, so it would be unlikely
 that there is complete randomness in the outcomes.
